                <h2>About the pandas</h2>
                <p>
                Why are the survival rates of infant pandas low?
Here are some reasons:

(1) Cubs are very needy and vulnerable at birth. They are born furless and blind. The limbs of newborn pandas are so weak that they are not able to stand at all.

Baby Panda
For 2 months after birth, baby pandas rely on the mother's warmth, milk, and protection.

(2) The infants can be accidentally crushed by their mothers.

(3) They don't have the right habitat.

(4) In the wild, half of all pandas give birth to twins; however, it is very rare for both cubs to survive as panda mothers are only able to raise one at a time and abandon the second twin.
